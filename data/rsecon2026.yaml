  info: "The conference committee is made up of volunteers who give time and effort from October 2025 to September 2026. You don’t have to be an RSE or in the UK to join. You don’t need experience in organising a conference as guidance will be given at all stages. RSECon26 marks the 10th year anniversary of the conference and we’re looking for people who are willing to volunteer for the RSE community and take an active part in organising the special event.\n\nDetails of the committee roles and the structure are given here:\n\n
society-rse.org/rse-conference-committee-structure/
\n\nThe conference is co-led by the Logistics Chair (Michael Donnay) and the Programme chair (Romain Thomas) and supported by the Logistics co-chair (TBD) and Programme co-chair (Twin Karmakharm). The chairs work primarily delivering their respective area, along with the Steering Group Chair (TBD), Fundraising Chair (TBD), Treasurer (TBD), and EDIA Chair (TBD) form a steering group for decision making."
