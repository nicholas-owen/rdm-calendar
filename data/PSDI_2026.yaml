    re you considering implementing an Electronic Research Notebook (ERN) for your institution or research group but aren’t sure where to start? Have you perhaps already tried to implement an ERN and were unable to overcome certain obstacles? Or are you a digital master who has successfully implemented one and want to share your experiences? Join us for a thought provoking online meeting to share knowledge around the practicalities, benefits, and success stories of ERN adoption.
    
    Event Audience
    This event is designed for anyone interested in digitising research workflows, moving from paper notebooks (lab or otherwise!) to digital solutions, and ensuring well-documented research data. Learn from real-world examples, discover different ERN options, and gain insight into the challenges and considerations required for successful ERN implementation.
